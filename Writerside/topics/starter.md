# CSS Layout Frameworks

In modern CSS, there are two main layout models used to create responsive and flexible web designs:
- Flexbox
- Grid

## Flexbox
It is a one-dimensional layout system, ideal for arranging items in a row or column.  
It helps distribute space and align items efficiently within a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.  

## Grid
It is a two-dimensional layout system, perfect for creating complex layouts with both rows and columns.  
It allows for precise control over positioning elements across multiple axes.
